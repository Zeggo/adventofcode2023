# Advent of Code 2023
My Advent of Code 2023 code puzzle solutions.

This year I am practicing TypeScript. I started learning JavaScript some months ago, and I have been using TypeScript for a small part of that.

These will mostly be quick and dirty solutions, with just general online searches and small tips from jpot to guide me. My main goal is to gain more confidence in coding, and to solve as many days as I can.
